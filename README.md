# PHASE 3 REACT WEEK ONE CODE CHALLENGE

    This code challenge involves three tests. We are to write solutions for the three questions/tests.

## Installation

    Follow the following link`https://github.com/Josphat0707/phase-3-week-one-code-challenge.git`. This link will lead you to the github repository where my work is saved/stored. Fork the repository in your computer and open in your vs code. Inside the vs code, open the terminal and manouver to the folder where you have stored the files then type in `python3 challenge1.py`, `python3 challenge2.py`,`python3 challenge3.py` and the program will run and you will get the results in the terminal.

## PROJECT SETUP
### Challenge 1(challenge1.py)
    In this first challenge, we were required to convert time from a 12hr clock system to a 24hr clock system. The hour should be the range of 1 to 12, the minute should be in the range of 0 to 59 and the period should be either "am" or "pm". 

    In my code i have defined the function converting_to_24hr_time and gave it three values , that is the hour, minute and period. I went ahead and wrote an if statement since the hour and minute values had conditions attached to them(range). Thats that, the other part of challenge1.py is self explanatory. 

### Challenge 2(challenge2.py)
    in the second challenge, we are to write a function that takes in three integers (a,b and c) then returns trrue if two of the three integers are positive numbers and greater than zero otherwise it returns 0. 

    In my solution i used the if statement so as to get to the final bit though i would have used the conditional expression but i havent grasped it yet.

### Challenge 3(challenge3.py)
    Am a bit stuck! :)
